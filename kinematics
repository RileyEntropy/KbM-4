KbM-4 primary goal: Intuitive for shooters. Promote and reinforce the following:
  Safety: admin tasks and menu pauses are conducted using selector switch
  Proper Stance: thin film capacitive touch sensor on buttstock for cheekweld activated ADS
    Secondary ADS CTS is avalible for "gamer mode"
  Grip: Maintain a firm, consistent grip on the rifle with your dominant hand.
  Shoulder Position: optional buttstock pressure switch to ensure stock is being propperly shouldered during "veteran mode"
  Trigger Control: ADS can be activated without finder on trigger. Pulling the trigger in panic response will result in hipfire and/or quickfire (ads/fire)
  Follow-Through: IMU control of fine aiming
  Reloading: "gamer mode" mag button reloading. 
  "Veteran Mode" reload requires mag release press> magazine baseplate press> bolt release press or charging handle pull
  Malfunction Drills: "Veteran Mode" possibly integrate randomized malfuction after programmable ammount of rounds
    Chamber display will read 
        "FTFeed (FAILURE TO FEED MALFUCNTION): Tap, Rack, Bang"
        "FTEjec (FAILURE TO EJECT MALFUNCTION), clear obstruction and continue firing" with a simple visual
        "DoubleFeed: Lock Bolt, eject mag, rack bolt (x3), tap, rack, bang" 
            while the actual process would be to insert mag instead of tap, it will be simplified to this since the input is the same
        "FTExtract Simp (FAILURE TO EXTRACT MALFUNCTION):
        ???"FTExtract Adv  pretty much disables the weapon until cleaning rod can be shoved into barrel
        ???"SQUIB: FYL" pretty much disables the weapon until cleaning rod can be shoved into barrel
???= might be going to far. Or perhaps not far enough...


Sencondary Goal: Performance. Attempt to reach optical mouse level of aiming performance
  using a combonation of novel solutions such as IMU, and TFT LCD emulating joystick, or trackball or combonation.

Fine Motor Skills:
  Trigger Control: Squeezing the trigger smoothly without disturbing aim.
  Adjusting Sights: Making small, precise adjustments to iron sights or optics.
  Magazine Release: Pressing the magazine release button to drop a mag.
  Reloading: Inserting a fresh magazine into the magwell with precision.
  Safety Manipulation: Flipping the safety on/off with the thumb or finger.
  Adjusting Grips or Attachments: Making small adjustments to rifle accessories like bipods, stocks, or grips.

Gross Motor Skills:
  Shouldering the Rifle: Bringing the rifle up to the shoulder.
  Recoil Management: Controlling the bodyâ€™s response to rifle recoil.
  Aiming: Raising the rifle into position and aligning sights or optics.
  Movement: Moving from cover to cover or changing positions with the rifle.
  Weapon Transitions: Switching from rifle to sidearm or back.
  Malfunction Clearing: Using larger movements to clear jams or fix misfires
